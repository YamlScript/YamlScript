# Print something # Print something As you see, we use `loop` to define a loop,
# it can be an literal array, like above, you can access the item by using
# \${item}, the index by using \${index}, just like javascript template strings
# You will use `use` to call a function, it can be any global function from
# deno. We also have some YAMLScript built-in functions, for example, we have
# `rss.entries` function, which can help you to get the fedd entries.(you can
# see all built-in function here

    - I'm so excited to explain 'YAMLScript' with 'YAMLScript'!
    - What is it?
    - YAMLScript is written in yaml format and can be compiled into javscript
      that runs in deno.
    - What can it do?
    - We can use it to manage our dotfiles, workflows like send feed entries to
      chat room, or we can even choose to deploy it to a serverless server such
      as deno deploy.
  use: console.log
  args: ${index}. ${item}

- name: Literal Variable
  desc:
    '`result` variable will be the last task returned result, please note\:
    `$result` is a variable, but `\${result}` is a string. `rss.entries`
    function will return an array, so we can loop the array like the following.

    How to run this yaml file? Cause YAMLScript depended Deno, so we should
    install https://deno.land/#installation first, as you see, we can run a
    command line tool that begins with a colon `:`, then YAMLScript will
    consider it as a cmd call. You also noticed that I use `if` with `false` to
    prevent this task.
  use: :brew install deno
  if: false
- name:
    Once deno installed in your local enviroment, you can install YAMLScript
    now.
  use: :deno install -A https://deno.land/x/YAMLScript/ys.ts
  if: false
- name: Now you can run this file
  use:
    :ys run
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YAMLScript/YAMLScript/main/README.ys.yml
  if: false
- name:
    You can also see the compiled javascript code , the built file will placed
    in `dist` folder, you can submit this folder to git, if you want to run the
    code with serverless service like deno deploy.
  use:
    :ys build
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YAMLScript/YAMLScript/main/README.ys.yml
  if: false

- name:
    You have seen we use `if` before, actually, we can use any condition here,
    you should't add $, or \${} in if condition.
  if: Date.now() > 0
  use: defg
  args:
    nowIsGreaterThanZero: true
- name:
    We can use assertEquals to test our code, once it failed, it'll throw an
    error. `assertEquals` is a built-in function, you can use it directly.
  use: assertEquals
  args:
    - $nowIsGreaterThanZero
    - true

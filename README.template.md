# YAMLScript

We use YAML syntax to define a set of tasks declaratively, YAMLScript will help
you compile it into Javascript code that runs on Deno.

We can use YAMLScript to run task files directly:

```bash
ys run task.ys.yml
```

Or we can also deploy the compiled Javascript files to serverless services such
as [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy):

```bash
ys build task.ys.yml && deployctl deploy --project=helloworld ./dist/task.js
```

YAMLScript is designed to solve the most common problems with minimal knowledge.
It can be considered as an alternative for
[dotfiles utilities](https://dotfiles.github.io/utilities/) such as
[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), or an alternative to automated workflows
such as [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), it can also be a low-code
alternative to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/),
[Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/), etc.

In YAMLScript, The following interface is the only property we need to
understand, they are all optional.

```typescript
interface Task {
  id?: string;
  name?: string;
  from?: string;
  use?: string;
  args?: unknown | unknown[];
  loop?: string | number | unknown[];
  if?: boolean | string;
  throw?: boolean;
}
```

And the compiled Javascript code is human readable, so if anything goes wrong,
we can easily locate and fix it. If you run into problems, go to the compiled
Javascript code, which is located in the `dist` directory by default.

### {{order}}.

```yaml
{{{source}}}
```

This will be compiled to:

   
```javascript
{{{target}}}
```

## Install

1. Yamlscript depends on Deno, so you should install
   [Deno](https://deno.land/#installation) first.
2. Install YAMLScript by running `deno install -A https://deno.land/x/YAMLScript/ys.ts`

```bash
ys run a.ys.yml
```

```bash
ys build a.ys.yml
```
## Notes

This README.md file is generated by the following YAMLScript.

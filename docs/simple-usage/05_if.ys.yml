# We can use `if` to control structures
# args is an built-in function, return the args
- use: def
  id: num
  args: 5

# You can use any js expression here, you may omit the expression syntax `$`
# Cause we evaluates the if conditional as an expression.
# this will print: yes, the args is greater than 4
- if: num > 4
  use: console.log
  args: yes, the args is greater than 4

- if: true
  use: console.log
  args: yes, it's true
